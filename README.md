# Image Captioning Service on GCE using Kubernetes

## Overview of the Cloud application

This application consists of 2 microservices:

1. [ui-service](https://github.com/sameer-pandit/ui-service) 
2. [caption-service](https://github.com/sameer-pandit/caption-service)

Using the yaml files in this repository, we built the Kubernetes deployments and services required. We have used Azure vision API to get the image captions

Look at the [description](./description.pdf) for inner details regarding how we built it
